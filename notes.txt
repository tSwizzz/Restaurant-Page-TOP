Notes to help me understand webpack process better.

First, run npm init -y --> creates package.json file

Then, npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev. This
creates a node_modules folder.

Put that node_modules folder into .gitignore --> touch .gitignore 
and then inside that file put node_modules/*

Create webpack.config.js file and copy paste the code  https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#using-a-configuration

Then add mode: 'development' at end of module.exports

Make src and dist folders --> ./src/index.js
                              ./dist/index.html

Link the main.js file in index.html, then npx webpack --config webpack.config.js

Then npx webpack --watch

to import styles.css --> npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader


*shortened how-to*
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
create webpack.config.js file, copy/paste code from https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#using-a-configuration
Add mode: 'development' at end
Make src and dust folders with index.js and index.html respectively, and link the ./main.js file
npx web pack --watch
