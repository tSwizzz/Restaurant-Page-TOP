Notes to help me understand webpack process better.

First, run npm init -y --> creates package.json file

Then, npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev. This
creates a node_modules folder.

Put that node_modules folder into .gitignore --> touch .gitignore 
and then inside that file put node_modules/*

Create webpack.config.js file and copy paste the code from that 
one website, then npx webpack --config webpack.config.js

Make src and dist folders --> ./src/index.js
                              ./dist/index.html

Link the main.js file in index.html


*shortened how-to*
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
create webpack.config.js file, copy/paste code from https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#using-a-configuration
then run npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
./src/index.js
./dist/index/html -->link main.js

To test, put a console.log message inside of index.js and 
check to see if content is displayed
